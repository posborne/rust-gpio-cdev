## [Unreleased]

## [v0.4.1] - 2021-03-08

- Properly document `async-tokio` feature.

## [v0.4.0] - 2020-08-01

- Removed pub "errors" module.  Error now exposed at top level.
- MSRV is now 1.39.0
- Add support behind a feature flag for reading events from a line as a Stream via tokio. [#35](https://github.com/rust-embedded/gpio-cdev/pull/35).

## v0.3.0 - 2020-02-10

Refactored Errors:
- Removed the `error-chain` dependency.
- Errors are now implemented "manually" with `ErrorKind` and `IoctlKind` enums.
- The encompassing `Error` type implements the `std::error::Error` trait.

## v0.2.0 - 2018-12-12

Adds the ability to create a collection of lines from a single chip and read or write those lines simultaneously with a single stystem call.

- A new `Lines` object (plural) was added. It is a collection of individual `Line` objects on a single `Chip` which can be read or written simultaneously with a single system call.
- A `Line` now just contains the reference to the Chip and the offset number. No system call is incurred when one is created.
- Information about an individual line is now represented by a separate `LineInfo` struct which can be obtained from the function `Line::info()`. This incurs a system call to retrieve the information.
- Creating a `Line` can't fail unless the caller specifies an offset that is out of range of the chip.
- The `LineIterator` can not fail since it checks the offset range. So now its item is just a `Line`, and not `Result<Line>`.
- There was no longer a need for `Line::refresh()` so it was removed.
- Since a `Line` object is trivial to create, it is now OK to have `Lines` be a simple collection of `Line` structs.

## v0.1.0 - 2018-09-28

- Initial release of the library with basic operations centered around operating
  on a single line at a time.
